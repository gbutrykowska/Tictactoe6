# Tictactoe6

My first attempt to create simple game in Python.

##What I aimed to learn
- How to split the project into some files in orderly manner, and import functions between created modules.
- Some better naming of classes, methods and variables
- Just how cool are list comprehensions
- What is an enum and how to create and use it in Python
- What is debugging
- More about object oriented programming, than from the simple exercises I have been doing before
